## File Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and clarity, please follow the naming convention when creating new files. Each file should be named in the format `contributorName_problemName.extension`. Here's a breakdown of the naming convention:

- **contributorName:** Your GitHub username or preferred contributor name.
- **problemName:** A concise and descriptive name for the specific problem or algorithm you are working on.
- **extension:** The file extension corresponding to the programming language you are using (e.g., `.js`, `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`).

### Examples:

- **JavaScript (JS):**
  - `./JS.johnDoe_array_operations.js`
    
- **Python:**
  - `./Python/janeSmith_linked_list_reverse.py`

- **Java:**
  - `./Java/johnDoe_ArrayOperations.java`

- **C++:**
  - `./C++/janeSmith_linked_list_reverse.cpp`
